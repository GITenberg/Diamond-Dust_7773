Many of the things I've said here are unflattering to someone, but nothing here is actionable defamation, partly because what I've said is true and partly \hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
because it's already been published in transcripts of in-court testimony that are public records.  Nobody put me up to writing this, and I can't imagine very many people could be happy that I have, but I wanted the catharsis of packaging these memories in

Nearly thirty years ago a mentor said to me, "There are two kinds of people in the world: those who get ulcers and those who give them to others., Which do you want to be?"  It took me \hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
some years to master the technique, but now I usually manage to get aggravations out of my system instead of brooding on them.  Oysters can turn their irritants into pearls, and I'd like to salvage some pearls of wisdom from mine.

Many of my attitu\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
des were shaped by my mother's sister.  My mother's abuse made any healthy relationship between us impossible, so for about ten years from my parents' divorce when I was thirteen, Aunt Ruth was in many ways my real parent.  She was amoral and apolitical a

d a lot like "Auntie Mame," and she taught me to evaluate things for myself and to measure them against my own standards and experience.  If she were still alive, she'd be proud of me for writing a book, but she wouldn't understand that it's payment of a 
\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 m\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 oral debt.

My late Aunt Frances would, though.  My father's mother died when I was an infant, so her youngest sister filled the place of a grandmother for me.  She was famous within the family for putting the words on people, and her words were oft
\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
en unsuitable for polite society.  From her I learned to call a spade a blankety blankety spade and to stand up to anyone who had done me or mine wrong.  One of my warmest memories is of the time I blessed Aunt Frances out for an insensitive remark she ha
\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 d\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1  made about my father in front of him, and she admitted she had been out of line.  That was the rite of passage that marked my arrival into adulthood.

Until about tw\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 o decades ago the duPonts ran Delaware as a company town, and they ran a tight ship.  For example, once upon a time du\~
Pont wanted to hire a high-level executive; a candidate and his family passed muster, and he was offered the position.  He said the only\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
problem with moving to Delaware was that his daughter was taking ice skating lessons and hoped someday to qualify for the Olympics, and there was no teacher of that caliber in Delaware.  Today there are, at the two Olympic-sized rinks down the road from W

I heard that story in 1974 from the people who interviewed me for a job on the professional staff of the University of Delaware, whose main campu\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1

They also explained to me that U. of D. was a private, not a public, school because if it were public it would be subject to the federal anti-segregation laws, and nobody wanted that.  So in an arrangement that may be unique, and which
\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
 is often called "semi-private," instead of making the school the state university and having the legislature appropriate money from the general treasury for it, each year the General Assembly votes for a voluntary donation to the private school, on behal

Delaware's e\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 conomy is, of course, the product of that political situation.  Du\~

Although there is a big Air Force base in Dover, the federal government is a relatively minor economic force, so federal pork barrels don't influence Delaware p\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
olitics much.  State and local governments don't employ a lot of people, and many government employees, even some of the highest elected officials, are allowed to have private employment at the same time, so political pigs have access to slop from other s

urces, not just the public trough.  The office of Attorney General, for example, is established in the state constitution; the AG heads the Department of Justice, is elected in a statewide election every four years, and stands third in line to become gove

nor if something happens to the governor, the lieutenant governor, and the secretary of state.  The AG can invalidate state statutes simply by issuing a written opinion, and no criminal complaint can even be filed, much less prosecuted, without the AG's a
\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 p\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 proval; in short, as Delaware's lawyer, the AG has complete control over all legal processes that involve the state government.

Incumbent AG Charles M. Oberly III, first elected in 1982, shortly started publishing a newsletter as a private busines\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1

s in some cases in Delaware courts, is written by Deputy AGs and typed by secretaries in the Dept. of Justice, both in the course of their public employment.  But the subscription money goes to Oberly personally, and although the quality of the newsletter
\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
is poor, compared to competing publications, the subscription price is lower, too, because Oberly doesn't have the same production costs as his competitors, and some of his subscribers have told me they see it as legal insurance -\~

So why don't they do that, if it would be easier and faster?  Because th\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
e big legal business in Delaware is corporation litigation, and nobody here wants to streamline the process and so cut down on the profits from it.  Most lawyers in Wilmington (which is the bulk of the lawyers in Delaware, using that word in several diffe
\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 r\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
ent senses) are or want to be local counsel for out-of-state lawyers in corporation cases; the ethics rules governing lawyers say they can't split fees except in the same proportions they split the work, and the only work local counsel can usually claim t
\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 o\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
 do is supply the expertise on local practice and precedents.  Because the procedural rules in Superior Court are very similar to those of the federal courts, and the Chancery Court rules are virtually identical to the federal rules, lawyers from anywhere
\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
in the country already know as much as they need to about local practice here, so all that's left for local counsel to do is provide gossip about the judge or other lawyers in the case and citations to prior opinions that have not been published in the na

ional reporters.  So Chancery Court issues tons of opinions that aren't published, say the same thing over and over again, and give local counsel the right to claim a large percentage of the fee for reviewing pertinent opinions.

The United States was founded on the idea of individuals' rights, but in\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
 Delaware corporations count for more than people do now.  Take the top state officials:  The governor and lieutenant governor are elected separately, so we can, and recently did, have a governor who was a Republican and a lieutenant who was a Democrat.

One of the reasons I believe that story is it fits all the circumstantial evidence.  There's no question Oberly has admitted publicly he wants to be a judge when he leaves the AG's office.  Had the Republican\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
s wanted their AG candidate elected in 1990, Gov. Castle could have appointed Oberly a judge in 1989 and then appointed a Republican to fill out the term, and that Republican would have come into the 1990 campaign as an incumbent and surely have won re-el
\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 e\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
ction.  But the charges against Wolf were still pending, and more Delaware voters are registered as Democrats than as Republicans:  They would have resented Oberly's selling them out, if he dismissed those charges on his way out or the new AG dismissed th
\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 e\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
m on the way in, and so voted against Wolf as a backlash.  Nor is there any other reasonable explanation for nominating Stone, who is a nice guy but doesn't know which end is up; there were Republicans who had not only sufficient legal experience but also
\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 the required public relations skills:  They should have nominated DAG M. Jane Brady to run against Oberly instead of against Senator Joseph R. Biden.

The deal Oberly made with the Democrats was he would help Carper oust the existing state party le\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1

who told him I was looking for a job, and the one at Hutton wasn't the kind I'd talked to Garrett about, but he'd like to tell me about it.  We discussed it a little, and when he invited me to Wilmington for an interview, I accepted.

At the intervi\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
ew, Butler outlined the Trust Company's history:  After some months of handling only pension trusts, the Trust Company wanted to get into personal trusts, so it had hired Butler away from one of the local banks to head the personal trust department; he'd 
\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 c\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1

\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 p\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
loyees about trusts.  In a year or so they might add an office on the West Coast, and in about three years Butler would be retiring; I figured that would give me time to learn what I needed to from Butler, and I'd either get to run the West Coast Office o

Much of the money in this country is in pension plans, most of them now "qualified plans" under the federal pension laws known as "E\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 RISA."  That money isn't tied up, out of circulation, though -\~

Then Hutton hired the Wilmington office of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, by some measures the biggest law firm in the count\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1

There was also the problem, actually several problems, that the Trust Company wasn't keeping any tax records.  For one thing, even though the pension trusts were exempt fr\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
om paying income tax, they still had to file information returns about their transactions each year, and you have to keep track of the tax basis of a pension trust's assets, because at some point you end up distributing those assets, and you have to know 
\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 w\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 hat they're worth for tax purposes then.  But the Trust Company wasn't keeping those records, and the customers kept complaining they couldn't get the information for their annual Forms 5500.

The third part of the problem didn't appear until we started doing personal trusts, and that was that non-pen\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1

 also its capital gain on the sale of those assets.  And Hitchcock hadn't activated the fields to keep track of the tax basis and fair market value of trust assets, because that information didn't appear in the brokerage firm's computer.

The complexity of the record-keeping and \hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
tax-reporting is a large part of the reason fiduciaries get paid such juicy trustees' fees, but somehow that concept had escaped the rocket scientists at Hutton, too.  Another reason for the fees is that trustees have to make some hard decisions about dis

ributing money from trusts:  Many trust documents give the trustees a lot of discretion about making both investments and pay-outs, and if you've ever been in the middle of a family squabble over a legacy you can appreciate that trustees earn their fees. 
\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
But Hutton skipped over those difficulties by letting the AE on each account make all the investment and pay-out decisions, so all Hutton Trust had to do to "earn" its fee was white-out and retype the statements.

Congressman James T. Broyhill of North Carolina had his share of the money from selling his family's furniture business that he needed to put in a blind trust t\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1

\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 n\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1

Mr. & Mrs. Burchard we\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1

Burchard had been president of.  They had retired to Arizona, and an AE in Hutton's Mesa office talked them into moving their trusts to Hutton Trust so he could sell the stock and use the proceeds to buy them some annuities from Hutton Life Insurance; the
\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1  \hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
commissions AEs got for selling Hutton insurance were even higher than their brokerage commissions.  By the time I found out about the trusts, the AE had already sold the stock, and when I told him annuities were an improper investment for the Burchards,

 Delaware on 30 June and had recently registered to vote, I didn't yet know the name of our only Representative, but I did know we had only one.  When he finally showed up in the small room where we were having soft drinks and cookies, he had his notebook

$100 million for some number of years I've forgotten now, but the Swiss bank insisted on having an American financial institution hold the bag, and IDP had been up one side of Wall Street and down the other and been turned down everywhere.  Then Bush aske

The last week of October 1984 I had to go to Basel, Swi\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
tzerland, on rather short notice to meet with Owen, Hausman, Walker, Ward, Craig, and someone from the Swiss bank, and that's when I finally saw the printout of how the transaction was supposed to work.  There were two kinds of problems with it:  One was 
\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 t\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
hat the bank wanted Hutton to sign as the one liable for paying the interest for the term of the loan and paying back the principal in Swiss francs at the end, so we would in effect be guaranteeing not only the interest rate on Treasuries but also the exc
\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 h\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
ange rate, and we wouldn't; the other was that there were so many finders' fees and up-front points to be paid to the various players that it would take every bit of income from the Treasuries, compounded by being repeatedly reinvested over the term of th
\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 e\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
 loan, to get the principal back to the amount to be repaid, and that didn't leave anything to pay the income taxes with.  When I pointed that out, Owen said, "But we don't want to pay any income taxes," and I said, "Nobody wants to pay income taxes, but 
\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 h\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 ow do you expect to get out of it?"  So they put me on the telephone to Mills -\~
- whom they always referred to as "the Chairman" with such reverence that Abbes tried teasing them once by referring to Fomon the same way, but they were not amused -\~- back i\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 n\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
 the States to find out what the story was on taxes.  That was the only time I ever talked to him, and he didn't have any idea how to get out of the taxes, either, but he said he'd get the guys there working on it.

One evening when I got back to my hotel after dinner, there were some urgent messages from Abbes to call back, so I did, and because of the time difference he was still in the office.  He got one of Hutton & Co.'s lawyers\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
 in New York on the phone with us to read us the riot act for my being there when the last thing the Legal Dept. had told me on Friday was not to go -\~

Keep in mind the timing -\~- this report came two weeks after the guilty plea to the check-kiting.  By now t\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
he white-out and retyping of the monthly reports was taking more than a month, so we had trusts that hadn't received a statement from us since at least February.  The bank where Hutton Trust had its three checking accounts refused to let us draw any more 
\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 p\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 ension checks on funds that hadn't been deposited yet, so we moved our accounts to a different Wilmington bank.

Then the federal judge in D.C. ordered Hutton to show cause why it shouldn't be removed as trustee in light of the check-kiting.  Despite my stren\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1

By the end of September, Hutton Trust was operating with a siege mentality:  Hutton Group was interviewing people to replace Abbes and Hitchcock as CEO and president, and several of us vp's, especially Ron Hatton and I, were ma\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1

\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 H\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1

Abbes and Hitchcock were upset and taking it out on us, and for the first time it wasn't much fun to work at Hutton Trust.  As a lawyer I had a particular problem:  The ethics rules prohibited my lying to a court, I was H\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1

deral securities laws and for extortion:  In 1986 Carl C. Icahn started buying more stock in Viacom International, Inc., and threatened to take the company over; in May Viacom bought back its stock from him, for $79.50 per share when it was trading at $62

 and he promised not to buy any more Viacom stock for eleven years.  Then Viacom sued him for extorting this "greenmail" from it, the federal court in New York dismissed the suit, and the appeals court affirmed, saying Viacom hadn't been damaged because w

One reason I say Ward is so smart it's scary is that one day in autumn 1985 I was in his office telling him what was happening at Hut\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1

In early 1987, while I was still looking for a lawyer to sue Hutton for me, I got another one of those nasty shocks that made me nervous about going up against Hutton:  The tv news shows were talking about Iranscam, and I\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1

n described in the 1985 report, what Shapiro helpfully described as the kind of problems you'd expect from having brokerage people trying to run a bank.  I'd never seen the 1986 report, and I hadn't asked for it during discovery because it was written aft

So I asked Shapiro if he'd reviewed any documents in preparation for testifying, and Bingo!  He admitted to reviewing the commissioner's\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
 1986 report, I asked for it, and Longobardi said they had to let me see it; Foster objected and kept dithering about it being too late for me to make a request for Hutton to produce documents, but that just showed she didn't understand the rules of evide

Neither Hutton nor I had asked to have a jury for the trial:  I didn't, because I thought the breaches of fiduciary duty, both the trustee's duties and the directors' duties, were too technica\hich\af1\dbch\af13\loch\f1 
l for many jurors to care about, and I wasn't sure a jury would see me as a sympathetic plaintiff; you'd have to ask Hutton why they didn't want a jury.  Besides, a jury comes back with a verdict, and you're pretty much stuck with it, but when you have th

this while it's hot and fresh in our minds."  The last brief was submitted on 7 December 1991; as I write this, in June 1992, we're still waiting for him to deliver the verdict.

\par \hich\af2\dbch\af13\loch\f2 array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af13\loch\f2 ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af13\loch\f2 status with the IRS.

\par \hich\af2\dbch\af13\loch\f2 States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af13\loch\f2 considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af13\loch\f2 with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
\par \hich\af2\dbch\af13\loch\f2 where\hich\af2\dbch\af13\loch\f2  we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
